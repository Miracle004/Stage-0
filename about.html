        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Ogunyemi Pelumi(Pelz), a curious developer on a journey in web development to understand the "why" and "how" behind how software applications work. There are so many web apps out there but i wanna focus on solving real-world problems 
          and create meaningful experiences for users. I studied comouter science and it has given me 
          a foundation solid enough to make me want to know how it all works underneath, so i keep learning because I know there's always more to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and push my boundaries and the "how it affects the real world" always give me a push to keep pushing on. 
          Whether it's building web apps or experimenting with new frameworks, I am interested. I don't want my curiousity to die out because "its not my stack". I'm always eager to grow and active.

        <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
        <p>
          Joining this program is a significant step in my development journey. Here are my key goals:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>My first goal would be to be able to work in fast-pace environments and ship fast</li>
          <li>To contribute in anyway to solutions that solve real problems</li>
          <li>Improve my problem-solving skills through hands-on challenges</li>
          <li>I want to get better at writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. </li>
          <li>Connect with fellow developers and learn from their experiences</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          I'm not gonna lie, i am lacking in alot of areas, so i'm currently working to strengthen 
          my skills in these areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>State management in complex apps</li>
          <li>Backend architecture and database design decisions</li>
          <li>Performance optimization and debugging in production environments</li>
          <li>Writing production ready code</li>
          <li>Understanding and implementing the current security practices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Those are major areas to be lacking, I know. But I see these as opportunities for growth. Each challenge is a chance 
          to learn something new and become a more well-rounded developer.

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          My Guy,
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember how excited and nervous you felt starting this journey? Hold onto that enthusiasm. 
          There will be moments when the code doesn't work, when you feel stuck, or when you question 
          your abilities. Push through those moments. Every bug you fix, every concept you grasp, and 
          every project you complete is building you into the developer you want to become.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't compare your progress to others cos that's the worst thing to do. Your journey is unique, and every small step forward 
          matters. Celebrate your wins, learn from your mistakes, and never stop being curious bruh. The 
          skills you're developing now will open doors you can't even imagine yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep coding, keep learning, don't isolate yourself and most importantly, keep believing in yourself.
        </p>

        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Technology is not just about writing code,it's about creating solutions that make a 
          difference. I'm particularly interested in how web apps can improve accessibility 
          and user experience for everyone, regardless of their background or abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active in the tech community, reading about emerging 
          stuff, i also dabble in web3 a bit, specifically privacy and security solutions. I'm a curious person so when something catches my attention i don't let go.
        <p>
          I'm excited about what lies ahead and grateful for the opportunity to learn, grow, and 
          contribute to meaningful projects.
